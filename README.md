# angular-atm-bank

to run this program go to the ClientApp folder and run npm i at command line
then open the solution in visual studio and build and run. it might take a few minutes to load, please wait for the angular CLI process to initialize
also if you get any error such as 'Get /' please run ng build at command line in ClientApp, there might be some issues created when I uploaded the files
